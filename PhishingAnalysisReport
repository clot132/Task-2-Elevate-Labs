## **Phishing Analysis Report:**

**1. DMARC Failure**

* DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) is designed to prevent spoofing by ensuring that the email comes from an authorized source aligned with the sender’s domain.
* The failure indicates this email did not pass domain verification, which is common in phishing emails trying to impersonate trusted organizations.

**2. SPF Alignment Problem**

* SPF (Sender Policy Framework) verifies if the sender's IP address is authorized to send mail on behalf of the domain.
* While the SPF check passed technically, the domain in the “From” address did not align with the authorized SPF domain, suggesting possible spoofing.

**3. DKIM Failure**

* DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) uses a cryptographic signature to verify the email’s integrity and sender domain authenticity.
* Failure of DKIM authentication and alignment suggests the email content may have been altered or forged, a red flag for phishing.
